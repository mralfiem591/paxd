# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, use GitHub's default features to privately report it to us. We will then patch it and add it to the vulnerabilities file, which will warn users of the vulnerability, and provide an easy way to update.

## Scanning for Vulnerabilities

You can scan all your installed packages, via the built in tool `paxd-vulnscan`. Execute it in your shell! Isn't installed? Install it with `paxd install paxd-vulnscan`. It's in this repository!
