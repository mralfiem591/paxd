Status update on PaxD Main Repository

UPDATE 1:

  Our SearchIndex is currently experiencing problems, and is out of date.
  We have temporarily started using the old PaxD method for searching.
  
  Please do not search during this time ("paxd search"), as it will take a while to complete.
  
  Thanks for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.

UPDATE 2:

  Following the previous issue, you may experience degraded preformance in installing packages.
  This is caused by the search index errors mentioned previously.

  Thanks for your patience while we work to resolve this issue.
