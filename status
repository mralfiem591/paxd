We are currently experiencing issues with our SearchIndex not being generated properly.

This will cause outdated results when using the "search" command.

We have temporarily disabled the search index, so PaxD will use its old search method.
Note that this can result in searching taking a while longer. (up to 7 minutes)

Thanks for your patience while we fix this issue.
